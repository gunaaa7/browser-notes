# PageNote Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 21, 2026

## Summary
PageNote is a local-first note-taking extension that lets you attach notes to web pages. Your notes are stored only on your device and resurface when you revisit the same page.

## What data PageNote collects
PageNote stores the following data locally on your device:
- **Your notes content** (the text you type)
- **A page identifier** derived from the page URL (canonicalized to remove common tracking parameters and normalize variations, including YouTube video IDs)
- **Optional metadata** needed for product functionality, such as last edited timestamp and storage usage statistics

## What PageNote does not collect
PageNote does not:
- Collect or transmit personal data to external servers
- Run analytics, telemetry, ads, or trackers
- Read or store passwords, payment details, or form content outside of what you type into the PageNote side panel

## How the data is used
Stored data is used only to:
- Show you the correct note when you revisit a page
- Display a badge indicator when a note exists for the current page
- Power the dashboard for viewing, searching, exporting, and checking storage usage

## Where the data is stored
All data is stored locally using **Chrome extension local storage** (`chrome.storage.local`) on your device. It is not synced to any cloud service by PageNote.

## Data sharing
PageNote does not share data with any third parties.

## Data retention and deletion
- Notes remain on your device until you delete them from the dashboard or by clearing extension data.
- You can export your notes from the dashboard at any time.

## Permissions explanation
PageNote may request permissions such as:
- **storage**: to save your notes locally
- **sidePanel**: to show the note editor in Chrome’s side panel
- **host permissions (http/https)**: to detect the current page and resurface the correct note, including handling SPA route changes and URL variations

PageNote does not use these permissions to transmit browsing data or track you.
