# sideNote Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows taskbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Guidelines

The icons should:
- Use a simple, clean design representing note-taking
- Be easily recognizable at small sizes
- Use the brand colors (blue/green theme)
- Have a consistent design across all sizes

## Suggested Design

A simple notepad or sticky note icon with:
- Light background (#ffffff or #f8f9fa)
- Primary color (#3b82f6 - blue)
- Optional accent color (#10b981 - green)
- Simple lines or text to represent writing

## Temporary Solution

For development/testing purposes, you can use any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel PNG files as placeholders. The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder.

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- Online icon generators
- Design tools like Figma, Canva, or Adobe Illustrator
- Icon fonts converted to PNG
- Simple drawing tools

Make sure all icons are in PNG format and properly sized.
